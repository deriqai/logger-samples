# Logger Samples

Logging is fundamental for observability and optimizations of large scale services.
Deriq.AI processes billions of log entries to extract insights that can lead to better quality and reliability. To start with DeriqAI, one has to instrument and generate logs with their own code.

Here are some samples for helpig you get started.

1. [Simple Logger with Open Telemetry](./otel-getting-started/) to get started with.
1. [Logger for a news service](./otel-news-service/) to get started with.

PS: See <https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/python/getting-started/> for a generic get started with Open Telemetry example. This example is mimicked in the getting started sample (1) above.
